A biological neural network is composed of a groups of chemically
connected or functionally associated neurons A single neuron may
be connected to many other neurons and the total number of
neurons and connections in a network may be extensive
Connections called synapses are usually formed from axons to
dendrites though dendrodendritic synapses and other connections
are possible Apart from the electrical signaling there are other forms
of signaling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion
