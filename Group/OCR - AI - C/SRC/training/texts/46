Biophysical models such as BCM theory have been important in
mechanisms for synaptic plasticity and have had
applications in both computer science and neuroscience Research is
ongoing in the algorithms used in the brain
with some recent biological evidence for radial basis and
neural backpropagation as mechanisms for
