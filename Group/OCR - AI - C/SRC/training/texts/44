Historically digital computers evolved from the von Neumann
model and operate via the execution of explicit instructions via
access to memory by a number of processors On the other hand
the origins of neural networks are based on efforts to model
information processing in biological systems Unlike the von
Neumann model neural network computing does not separate
memory and processing
Neural network theory has served both to better identify how the
neurons in the brain function and to provide the basis for efforts
to create artificial intelligence
