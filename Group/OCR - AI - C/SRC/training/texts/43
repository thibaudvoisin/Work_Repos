Artificial intelligence cognitive modeling and neural networks
are information processing paradigms inspired by the way
biological neural systems process data Artificial intelligence and
cognitive modeling try to simulate some properties of biological
neural networks In the artificial intelligence field artificial
neural networks have been applied successfully to speech
recognition image analysis and adaptive control in order
to construct software agents in computer and video games or
autonomous robots
