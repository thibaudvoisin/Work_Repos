A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons or in a modern
sense an artificial neural network composed of artificial neurons or
nodes Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network
made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network for
solving artificial intelligence AI problems The connections of the
biological neuron are modeled as weights A positive weight reflects
an excitatory connection while negative values mean inhibitory
connections All inputs are modified by a weight and summed This
activity is referred to as a linear combination Finally an activation
function controls the amplitude of the output For example an
acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1 or it could be
1 and 1
