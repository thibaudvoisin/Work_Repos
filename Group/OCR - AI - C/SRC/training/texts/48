Variants of the back-propagation algorithm as well as unsupervised
methods by Geo Hinton and colleagues at the University of
Toronto can be used to train deep highly nonlinear neural
architectures similar to the 1980 Neocognitron by Kunihiko
Fukushimaand the standard architecture of vision inspired by the
simple and complex cells by David H Hubel and Torsten
Wiesel in the primary visual
